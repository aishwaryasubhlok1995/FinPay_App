# FinPay_App
Cloud Computing

The system provides a user-friendly front-end interface that allows customers to easily initiate transactions and a robust back-end system that handles the processing and settlement of funds. The server-side application is the main FlexPay Server. The server is connected to Autonomous Database (ADB) available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Once the server is running, it checks the status of ADB and if that is currently not available, then restarts the provisioned ADB. The system will also include fraud prevention capabilities by using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure the security of customers' information and transactions. MFA will be implemented using Microsoft Authenticator. Microsoft Authenticator provides an offline TOTP service which is better and safer than traditional sms-based MFA. The project will be over the cloud and the scope includes the development of the payment system (backend and UI), testing, and deployment. The users can store their profiles for faster payments and easy recognition. Overall, the FlexPay Payment project aims to create a payment system that is  reliable, secure, and easy to use for both customers and merchants, while meeting all industry standards.
